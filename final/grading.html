  <h2>Grading System</h2>
<p>
Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by route-setters and climbers. The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system.
The V-scale, which originated in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.
The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system, with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters a, b, and c. For example, Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6, while Fontainebleau 7C+ is equivalent to V10. In both systems, grades are further differentiated by appending "+" to indicate a small increase in difficulty. Despite this level of specificity, ratings of individual problems are often controversial, as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem may be for a particular climber. Height, arm length, flexibility, and other body characteristics can also be relevant to perceived difficulty.

  <tr>
    <td>V0-V2/4-5+</td>
    <td>For beginner climbers who are learning the movements ahd have been bouldering for no more than about 2-3 months.</td>
  <tr>
    <td>V3-V5/6A-6C+</td>
    <td>For intermediate climbers who have been bouldering for a while now and have gained some strength within the movements. You can flash problems (succesful first try) that you could not do when you first started.</td>
  <tr>
    <td>V6-V8/7A-7B
      <td>For advanced climbers those who have been boldering for a few years. At the this point the rapid rate of progression slows down.</td>
  <tr>
    <td>V9-V-12/7B+-8a+<.td>
    <td>For expert climbers who have been bouldering and training hard for many years. You are most likely one of the top boulder's at your local gym, and can boulder outdoors consistently.</td>
  <tr>
    <td>≥V13/≥8B</td>
    <td>For elite clilbmers who consider bouldering one of their top priorities. You are most likely sponsored and who people learn from.</td>
